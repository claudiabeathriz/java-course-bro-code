# Lesson 08 - Math Class

This lesson introduces the **`Math` class** in Java, which provides a collection of methods and constants for performing mathematical operations.

## Topics Covered
- **Mathematical constants**:
  - `Math.PI` → The value of π (3.14159…)
  - `Math.E` → The base of natural logarithms (2.718…)
- **Common methods**:
  - `Math.pow(a, b)` → Returns `a` raised to the power of `b`
  - `Math.abs(x)` → Returns the absolute value of `x`
  - `Math.sqrt(x)` → Returns the square root of `x`
  - `Math.round(x)` → Rounds `x` to the nearest integer
  - `Math.ceil(x)` → Rounds `x` upward to the nearest integer
  - `Math.floor(x)` → Rounds `x` downward to the nearest integer
  - `Math.max(a, b)` → Returns the larger of two values
  - `Math.min(a, b)` → Returns the smaller of two values

## Learning Notes
- The `Math` class is part of the **java.lang** package, so it does not need to be imported.  
- Methods in `Math` are **static**, meaning you call them using `Math.methodName()` without creating an object.  
- It is commonly used in calculations, simulations, statistics, and problem-solving.
