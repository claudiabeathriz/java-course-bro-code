Lesson 34 - Multidimensional Arrays

This lesson introduces multidimensional arrays, specifically 2D arrays, where each element of the array is itself another array.
They are particularly useful for storing and organizing data in a matrix-like structure, such as tables, grids, or grouped lists.

*Topics Covered*

- Understanding 2D (multidimensional) arrays
- Creating and initializing arrays of arrays
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D array
- Iterating through multidimensional arrays using nested loops

*Notes*

A multidimensional array can be visualized as rows and columns of data.
You can mix array sizes (known as jagged arrays) — each inner array can have a different length.
Access elements using multiple indices, e.g., array[row][column].
Use nested loops to process all elements efficiently.
