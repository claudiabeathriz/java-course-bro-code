Lesson 18 – Calculator Program  

This program demonstrates how to create a simple **calculator** in Java that performs arithmetic operations based on user input. It uses the **`switch` expression**, **`Scanner`** for input, and **`Math.pow()`** for exponentiation.

*Concepts Covered*
- User input with `Scanner`
- `switch` statement (enhanced arrow syntax)
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional checks (division by zero)
- `Math.pow()` for exponents

*Notes*
- Scanner reads user input from the console.
- The arrow syntax (->) in switch is available from Java 14+.
- Math.pow(a, b) returns a raised to the power of b.
- Always close the scanner with scanner.close() to avoid resource leaks.
