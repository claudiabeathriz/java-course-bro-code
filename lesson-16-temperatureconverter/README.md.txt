A simple Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the ternary operator for concise conditional logic.

📘 Description

This program allows the user to:

Enter a temperature value.
Choose whether to convert it to Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F).
Instantly see the converted result formatted with one decimal place.

It demonstrates:
User input with Scanner
Use of the ternary operator (? :) for inline conditionals
Output formatting with System.out.printf()

🧠 Concepts Practiced

Scanner class for user input
Conditional (ternary) operator
Mathematical expressions for temperature conversion
Formatted output using printf

🧮 Conversion Formulas

°C = (°F − 32) × 5/9
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

💡 Example
Enter the temperature:
100
Convert to Celsius or Fahrenheit? (C or F) C
37.8ºC
