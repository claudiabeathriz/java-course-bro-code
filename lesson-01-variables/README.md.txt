Lesson 01 - Variables

This lesson introduces **variables** in Java.  
Variables are used to store data values such as numbers, text, or booleans.

**Topics Covered**
- Declaring variables;
- Assigning values;
- Printing variables;
- Understanding data types (byte, short, char, int, long, float, double, boolean, String (non-primitive)).

**Identifiers**
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

*Code Example*
See [Variables.java](./Variables.java) for the complete code.
