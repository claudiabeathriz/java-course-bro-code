Lesson 19 - Logical Operators

This lesson introduces logical operators in Java, which allow you to combine or invert boolean expressions to create more complex conditions.

*Topics Covered*

- Logical operators:

&& → AND: true if both conditions are true

|| → OR: true if at least one condition is true

! → NOT: inverts the boolean value (true → false, false → true)

- Using logical operators in conditions:
- Combine multiple rules in if statements
- Check for allowed or disallowed input (e.g., username validation)
- Handle multiple scenarios in decision-making (e.g., weather conditions)

*Notes*

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a single if statement.
&& (AND) → all conditions must be true.
|| (OR) → at least one condition must be true.
! (NOT) → reverses the boolean value.
They are essential for input validation, decision-making, and complex conditional logic.
