Lesson 32 - Search in Array

This lesson demonstrates how to search for an element inside an array using a simple linear search algorithm.
It checks each element of the array one by one until a match is found (or not found).

*Topics Covered*

- Linear search in arrays
- Comparing strings with .equals()
- Using boolean flags for search results

*Notes*

For strings, always use .equals() instead of == for comparisons.
For numeric arrays, you can use == directly.
This is called a linear search because it checks elements one by one in sequence.
