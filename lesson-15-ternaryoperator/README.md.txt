### 🧠 What is the Ternary Operator?
The ternary operator is a compact form of an `if-else` statement.  
Its syntax is:

variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

🧠 Notes

Ideal for simple conditions with only two possible outcomes.
For complex logic, traditional if-else statements are clearer.
Works with any data type (e.g., int, String, boolean).
