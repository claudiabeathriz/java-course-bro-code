Lesson 22 - For Loops

This lesson introduces for loops in Java, which allow you to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. Unlike while loops that depend on a condition, for loops are ideal when you know exactly how many iterations are needed.

*Topics Covered*

For loop structure

	for (initialization; condition; update) {
    	// code to execute
	}

Initialization: sets the starting value (usually a counter variable).
Condition: loop continues while this is true.
Update: modifies the counter after each iteration.

*Notes*

The for loop is best used when the number of repetitions is known in advance.
The Thread.sleep() method can only be used inside methods that declare throws InterruptedException.
Combining loops with user input allows you to make interactive programs, like countdown timers or repeated actions.
