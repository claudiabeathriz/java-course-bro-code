Lesson 16: Temperature Converter

A simple Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the ternary operator for concise conditional logic.

This program allows the user to:

Enter a temperature value.
Choose whether to convert it to Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F).
Instantly see the converted result formatted with one decimal place.

It demonstrates:
User input with Scanner
Use of the ternary operator (? :) for inline conditionals
Output formatting with System.out.printf()

*Concepts Practiced*

- Scanner class for user input
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Mathematical expressions for temperature conversion
- Formatted output using printf

*Conversion Formulas*

°C = (°F − 32) × 5/9
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

*Example*
Enter the temperature:
100
Convert to Celsius or Fahrenheit? (C or F) C
37.8ºC
