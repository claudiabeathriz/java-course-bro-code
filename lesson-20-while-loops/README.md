Lesson 20 - While Loops

This lesson introduces the while loop in Java, which allows you to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true. It’s commonly used when the number of repetitions is not known in advance — for example, waiting for user input or monitoring a process until a condition changes.

*Topics Covered*
- While loop syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to repeat
}

- Condition evaluation:

The loop runs while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, the loop stops.

*Notes*
- The while loop is a pre-test loop, meaning it checks the condition before executing the block.
- It’s useful when the number of iterations depends on user input or dynamic conditions.
- Be careful to update the variable inside the loop — otherwise, it may result in an infinite loop.
- You can combine while with logical operators (&&, ||, !) to make more complex loop conditions.
