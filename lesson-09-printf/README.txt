Lesson 09 - Printf

This lesson introduces the **`printf()` method** in Java, which is used to format and print output.  
It allows control over how text, numbers, and other data types are displayed, making output cleaner and more professional.

*Topics Covered*
- Basic usage of `printf()`
- Format specifiers:
  - `%s` → Strings
  - `%c` → Characters
  - `%d` → Integers
  - `%f` → Floating-point numbers
  - `%b` → Booleans
- Precision control (e.g., `%.2f` for 2 decimal places)
- Flags:
  - `+` → Shows sign for positive numbers
  - `,` → Adds grouping separators (commas)
  - `(` → Encloses negative numbers in parentheses
  - `space` → Adds a space before positive numbers
- Width and padding:
  - `0` → Zero-padding
  - Positive number → Right-aligned
  - Negative number → Left-aligned

*Notes*
- `printf()` is part of **formatted output** in Java, offering more control than `println()`.  
- It is widely used in console applications, reporting, and debugging.  
- Formatting is especially useful when working with financial data, tabular output, and user-friendly displays.
