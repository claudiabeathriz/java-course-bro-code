Lesson 06 - If Statements

This lesson introduces **if statements** in Java.  
The program demonstrates how to use conditional logic to make decisions based on user input.

*Topics Covered*
- Using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- Evaluating conditions with relational and logical operators
- Handling multiple conditions
- Taking input with `Scanner`
- Working with `String`, `int`, and `boolean`

*How the Program Works*
1. The program asks the user for:
   - Their **name** (`String`)
   - Their **age** (`int`)
   - Whether they are a **student** (`boolean`)

2. It evaluates conditions:
   - If the name is empty, it shows a warning.
   - Depending on the age, it categorizes the person (senior, adult, child/teenager, newborn, unborn, etc.).
   - It checks if the user is a student and prints the result.

3. The program outputs personalized messages based on these conditions.

*Example Run*
Enter your name:
Claudia
Enter your age:
22
Are you a student? (true/false)?
true
Hello, Claudia!
You are an adult!
You are a student.
Apply branching logic to control program flow.
