Lesson 05 - Shopping Cart Program

This lesson introduces a simple **shopping cart program** in Java.  
It demonstrates how to use the `Scanner` class to take input from the user, work with different data types, perform arithmetic calculations, and display formatted output.

*Topics Covered*
- Taking user input with `Scanner`
- Working with strings, integers, doubles, and characters
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Displaying results with concatenation

*How the Program Works*
1. The user is asked for:
   - The name of the item
   - The price per unit
   - The desired quantity

2. The program calculates the total cost:  
total = price * quantity

3. The program prints a summary with the total price.

*Example Run*
