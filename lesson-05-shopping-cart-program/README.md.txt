# Lesson 04 - Shopping Cart Program

This lesson introduces a simple **shopping cart program** in Java.  
It demonstrates how to use the `Scanner` class to take input from the user, work with different data types, perform arithmetic calculations, and display formatted output.

## Topics Covered
- Taking user input with `Scanner`
- Working with strings, integers, doubles, and characters
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Displaying results with concatenation

## How the Program Works
1. The user is asked for:
   - The name of the item
   - The price per unit
   - The desired quantity

2. The program calculates the total cost:  
total = price * quantity

3. The program prints a summary with the total price.

## Example Run
What item would you like to buy?
Notebook
What is the price for each?
2.5
How many would you like?
4
You have bought 4 Notebook(s). Your total is $10.0.


## How to Compile & Run
1. Open a terminal in the folder containing `ShoppingCartProgram.java`.
2. Compile the program:
javac ShoppingCartProgram.java
Run the program:
java ShoppingCartProgram

## Learning Outcome
After this lesson, you should be able to:

Use Scanner to read user input.
Work with basic data types (String, int, double, char).
Perform simple arithmetic operations.
Display output by concatenating strings and variables.
