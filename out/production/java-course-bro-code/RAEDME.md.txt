Lesson 29 - Dice Roller Program

This lesson introduces a Dice Roller Program that simulates rolling one or more dice using Java’s Random class. It’s a fun and practical way to learn about loops, methods, conditional logic, random number generation, and ASCII art output.

*Topics Covered*

- Using the Random class to generate random integers
- Accepting user input with the Scanner class
- Implementing loops to repeat actions based on user input
- Applying conditionals to validate input
- Creating methods to modularize the code (printDice)
- Displaying ASCII art to represent dice visually

*Program Logic*

The user is asked to input the number of dice they want to roll.

The program checks if the input is greater than zero.

If valid:

The program rolls each die (using a random number between 1 and 6).

Displays each roll as an ASCII art representation.

Keeps a running total of all rolled values.

After all dice are rolled, the total sum is displayed.

If the user enters a number less than or equal to zero, an error message is shown.

*Notes*

The Random class method nextInt(1, 7) generates a number from 1 to 6, simulating a real die.
The program ensures input validation so negative or zero dice are not accepted.
Using ASCII art improves user experience and makes output visualization more engaging.
The printDice() method demonstrates modular design, separating logic for display from program flow.
