Lesson 15 – Ternary Operator  

This lesson introduces the **ternary operator** in Java — a concise way to write simple conditional statements that return one of two values based on whether a condition is true or false.  

*Concepts Covered*
- Conditional expressions  
- Ternary operator syntax  
- Simplifying `if-else` statements  

*What is the Ternary Operator?*
The ternary operator is a compact form of an `if-else` statement.  
Its syntax is:

variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

*Notes*

Ideal for simple conditions with only two possible outcomes.
For complex logic, traditional if-else statements are clearer.
Works with any data type (e.g., int, String, boolean).
