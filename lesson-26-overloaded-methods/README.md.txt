lesson 26 - Overloaded Methods

This lesson demonstrates the concept of method overloading, where multiple methods share the same name but differ in their parameter lists (number or type of parameters). Method overloading allows you to perform similar operations using the same method name with different inputs.

*Topics Covered*

Overloaded Methods: Methods that share the same name but have different signatures (name + parameters).

Java determines which method to call based on the number and type of arguments provided.

Method overloading improves code readability and reusability.

Each overloaded method must differ in parameter types or number of parameters.

Return type alone is not enough to overload a method.
